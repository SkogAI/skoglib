# PRD: skogai-python-library

## Executive Summary

The skogai-python-library is a foundational Python package that serves as a single source of truth for common AI agent implementations within the SkogAI ecosystem. By centralizing frequently used operations and providing standardized interfaces, this library eliminates redundant implementations across projects and ensures consistency in AI agent behavior.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- AI Agents across different SkogAI projects implement the same functionality in multiple, inconsistent ways
- No centralized location for common patterns and utilities used by AI agents
- Repetitive code development for operations that occur "hundreds of times per project"
- Lack of standardization leads to maintenance overhead and potential inconsistencies

**Why This Matters Now:**
- As the SkogAI ecosystem grows, the cost of maintaining duplicate implementations increases exponentially
- Inconsistent implementations can lead to unpredictable agent behavior across different contexts
- Development velocity is slowed by repeatedly solving the same problems

## User Stories

### Primary Persona: AI Agent Developer
**Needs:** Quick access to proven, standardized implementations for common operations

**User Journey:**
1. Agent encounters a common task (e.g., running another SkogAI executable)
2. Instead of writing custom implementation, imports standardized function from skogai-python-library
3. Calls function with appropriate parameters
4. Receives consistent, reliable results

**Pain Points Being Addressed:**
- Time spent researching and implementing common patterns
- Inconsistency across different agent implementations
- Maintenance burden of duplicate code
- Lack of centralized documentation for best practices

### Secondary Persona: SkogAI Platform Maintainer
**Needs:** Single location to update and improve common implementations

**User Journey:**
1. Identifies improvement or bug fix needed in common functionality
2. Updates implementation once in skogai-python-library
3. All dependent agents benefit from the improvement automatically
4. Maintains consistency across the entire ecosystem

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Features:**
- **Executable Runner**: Standardized interface for running and managing other SkogAI executables
- **Common Utilities**: Frequently used helper functions and classes
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling patterns across operations
- **Configuration Management**: Standard configuration loading and validation
- **Logging Integration**: Unified logging approach for all library operations

**User Interactions:**
- Simple import statements: `from skogai import executable_runner`
- Intuitive function calls with clear parameter documentation
- Consistent return types and error patterns
- Optional configuration through environment variables or config files

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:**
- Minimal import overhead (< 100ms)
- Efficient resource utilization for common operations
- No unnecessary dependencies that bloat agent environments

**Reliability:**
- 99%+ uptime for critical path operations
- Graceful degradation when external dependencies unavailable
- Comprehensive error recovery mechanisms

**Security:**
- Secure handling of credentials and sensitive data
- Input validation and sanitization for all public interfaces
- No exposure of internal system information

**Maintainability:**
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- Clear API documentation with examples
- Semantic versioning for backward compatibility

**Scalability:**
- Thread-safe implementations for concurrent agent operations
- Minimal memory footprint
- Efficient handling of batch operations

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

**Primary Metrics:**
- **Code Reuse Rate**: >80% of new AI agent projects use skogai-python-library
- **Implementation Consistency**: 100% of agents using library have consistent behavior for common operations
- **Development Velocity**: 50% reduction in time spent implementing common patterns
- **Bug Reduction**: 75% reduction in bugs related to common operations across projects

**Secondary Metrics:**
- Library adoption rate across existing SkogAI projects
- Number of duplicate implementations eliminated
- Developer satisfaction scores for library usability
- Time to onboard new agent developers

### Key Performance Indicators

- Library download/usage statistics
- Number of GitHub issues related to inconsistent implementations (should decrease)
- Code review time reduction for common operations
- Developer productivity metrics for agent development

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must be compatible with UV package manager exclusively
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing SkogAI architecture
- Cannot introduce breaking changes to existing agent interfaces
- Must maintain minimal dependency footprint

### Resource Constraints
- Development timeline depends on current team capacity
- Testing must cover all supported SkogAI executables
- Documentation must be maintained alongside code changes

### Assumptions
- AI agents will adopt standardized implementations willingly
- UV will remain the primary package manager for SkogAI ecosystem
- Common patterns identified initially will remain relevant as ecosystem evolves
- SkogAI executable interfaces will remain stable or evolve in backward-compatible ways

## Out of Scope

**Version 1.0 Exclusions:**
- Integration with non-SkogAI executables or external systems
- Web-based interfaces or REST APIs
- Package managers other than UV
- Backward compatibility with legacy Python versions (< 3.8)
- GUI components or visual interfaces
- Database-specific integrations beyond common patterns
- Custom AI model implementations (focus on orchestration, not models)

**Future Considerations:**
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Integration with external AI platforms
- Performance monitoring and telemetry
- Advanced caching mechanisms

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **UV Package Manager**: Required for installation and dependency management
- **SkogAI Executables**: Library must interface with existing SkogAI tools
- **Python Standard Library**: Core functionality built on standard library where possible

### Internal Dependencies
- **SkogAI Core Team**: Coordination on interface standards
- **Agent Development Teams**: Feedback on required functionality and usability
- **Platform Architecture Team**: Alignment with overall SkogAI ecosystem design

### Blocking Dependencies
- Completion of SkogAI executable interface standardization
- Agreement on common operation definitions across agent teams
- Establishment of testing infrastructure for integrated scenarios

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)
- Core executable runner functionality
- Basic error handling and logging
- Initial UV packaging setup
- Essential documentation

### Phase 2: Expansion
- Additional common utilities based on usage patterns
- Enhanced configuration management
- Performance optimizations
- Comprehensive test suite

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration
- Migration tools for existing agents
- Advanced monitoring capabilities
- Community contribution guidelines
- Long-term maintenance framework

## Risk Mitigation

**Adoption Risk**: Ensure library provides immediate value and is easy to integrate
**API Stability Risk**: Implement comprehensive versioning strategy from day one  
**Performance Risk**: Continuous benchmarking and optimization
**Maintenance Risk**: Establish clear ownership and contribution processes
