# Project Brief

## Project Identity

**Name**: skoglib  
**Repository**: https://github.com/SkogAI/skoglib.git  
**Version**: 0.1.0  
**Author**: Emil Skogsund <emil@skogsund.se>  
**Organization**: SkogAI  

## Project Scope

### What It Is
skoglib is a foundational Python library designed to provide shared utilities, API clients, and common functionality for the SkogAI ecosystem. It serves as a core dependency that can be reused across multiple Python projects within the organization.

### What It Solves
- **Code Duplication**: Eliminates repeated utility functions across SkogAI projects
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Provides standardized approaches to common tasks
- **Integration Complexity**: Simplifies interaction with SkogAI services
- **Development Overhead**: Reduces setup time for new Python projects

### What It Doesn't Do
- **Framework Replacement**: Not a web framework or application framework
- **Domain-Specific Logic**: Avoids business logic specific to individual applications
- **Heavy Dependencies**: Maintains zero runtime dependencies for compatibility
- **Platform-Specific Features**: Focuses on cross-platform compatibility

## Key Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Shared Foundation**: Provide reusable components for SkogAI Python projects
2. **Zero Dependencies**: Maintain minimal runtime footprint
3. **Type Safety**: Deliver fully typed interfaces for reliable development
4. **Modern Python**: Leverage Python 3.13+ features and performance

### Success Criteria
- **Internal Adoption**: Used by 80%+ of SkogAI Python projects within 6 months
- **Quality Gates**: Maintain >95% test coverage and zero security vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Library import time under 100ms, memory usage under 10MB
- **Developer Experience**: Full type annotations and comprehensive documentation

## Project Boundaries

### In Scope
- **Utility Functions**: Common helpers and data transformations
- **API Clients**: Standardized SkogAI service clients
- **Configuration**: Unified configuration management patterns
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interface for library functionality
- **Data Models**: Shared data structures and validation

### Out of Scope
- **Web Frameworks**: No web server or HTTP framework functionality
- **Database ORMs**: No database abstraction layers
- **Async Frameworks**: No async runtime or event loop management
- **GUI Components**: No graphical user interface elements
- **Third-Party Integrations**: No external service integrations beyond SkogAI

## Technical Constraints

### Hard Requirements
- **Python Version**: Must support Python 3.13+
- **Dependencies**: Zero runtime dependencies
- **Type Coverage**: 100% type annotation coverage
- **Security**: Pass security scans (bandit) with zero high-severity issues

### Soft Requirements
- **Performance**: Fast import times and minimal memory usage
- **Cross-Platform**: Work on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **IDE Support**: Excellent IDE integration through type hints
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation and examples

## Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
- **SkogAI Development Team**: Internal users and contributors
- **Emil Skogsund**: Project owner and primary maintainer
- **Python Community**: External users and potential contributors

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **SkogAI Operations**: Deployment and infrastructure considerations
- **Security Team**: Security review and compliance requirements
- **Partner Developers**: External integrators using the library

## Resources & Constraints

### Available Resources
- **Development Time**: Primary developer (Emil) with Claude Code assistance
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub repository with Actions CI/CD
- **Tooling**: Modern Python development stack (UV, Ruff, mypy, pytest)

### Resource Constraints
- **Team Size**: Single primary developer initially
- **Timeline**: Self-imposed deadline for timely delivery
- **Budget**: Open source project with minimal external costs

## Risk Management

### Key Risks
1. **Adoption Risk**: Internal teams may not adopt the library
   - *Mitigation*: Engage with team leads early for feedback
2. **Maintenance Burden**: Library becomes difficult to maintain
   - *Mitigation*: Keep scope minimal and well-tested
3. **Breaking Changes**: API evolution breaks existing users
   - *Mitigation*: Semantic versioning and migration guides

### Quality Risks
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Potential security issues
  - *Mitigation*: Automated security scanning and regular updates
- **Performance Degradation**: Library becomes slow or memory-hungry
  - *Mitigation*: Performance benchmarking and optimization
- **Compatibility Issues**: Library doesn't work across platforms
  - *Mitigation*: Cross-platform testing in CI/CD

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication
- **Progress Updates**: Weekly updates on development progress
- **Design Decisions**: Document architectural choices in context files
- **Issue Tracking**: GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests

### External Communication
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and API documentation
- **Release Notes**: Clear changelog for each version
- **Community**: GitHub discussions for community engagement
