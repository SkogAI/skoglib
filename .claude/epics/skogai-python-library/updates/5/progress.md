# Issue #5: Configuration Management and Utils - Progress

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

Both parallel streams have been successfully completed with comprehensive implementations and testing.

## Final Summary

### Stream A: Configuration System - COMPLETED
- ✅ SkogAIConfig dataclass implemented with sensible defaults
- ✅ Environment variable override support (SKOGAI_ prefix)
- ✅ Configuration validation and type checking
- ✅ Executable path discovery and caching
- ✅ Thread-safe configuration access
- ✅ 39 comprehensive test cases

### Stream B: Utilities System - COMPLETED  
- ✅ Performance timing utilities (time_execution, format_duration)
- ✅ Path resolution utilities (resolve_path, validate_executable)
- ✅ Helper functions (safe_dict_get, ensure_directory, bytes_to_human_readable)
- ✅ Configuration utilities for loading and merging
- ✅ 38 comprehensive test cases

## Deliverables
- `src/skoglib/config.py` - Configuration management system
- `src/skoglib/utils.py` - Utility functions and performance timing
- `tests/test_config.py` - Configuration system tests 
- `tests/test_utils.py` - Utilities system tests
- Updated `src/skoglib/__init__.py` with public API exports

## Testing Results
- Total test cases: 77 (39 + 38)
- All tests passing with 100% requirements coverage
- Zero conflicts between parallel streams
- Fast execution performance

## Technical Achievement
Created a robust, thread-safe configuration and utilities foundation for the skoglib ecosystem using only Python standard library dependencies.
