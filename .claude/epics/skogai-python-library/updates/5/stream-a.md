# Stream A: Configuration System

## Scope
Implement `src/skoglib/config.py` with:
- SkogAIConfig dataclass with sensible defaults
- Environment variable override support with SKOGAI_ prefix
- Configuration validation and type checking
- Executable path discovery and caching
- Thread-safe configuration access

## Files
- src/skoglib/config.py (✓ created)
- tests/test_config.py (✓ created)

## Implementation Details

### SkogAIConfig Dataclass
- Implemented with sensible defaults: timeout=30s, max_output_size=10MB, log_level="INFO"
- Full validation with proper error messages using ConfigurationError
- Support for executable search paths configuration

### Environment Variable Support
- SKOGAI_ prefix for all environment variables
- Type conversion with proper error handling
- Support for colon-separated search paths like system PATH

### Thread Safety
- Thread-safe singleton pattern with double-checked locking
- Global get_config() function for consistent access
- reset_config() function for testing and cache clearing

### Executable Discovery
- find_executable() function with custom search paths
- validate_executable() for path validation
- resolve_path() for handling relative/absolute paths
- merge_configs() utility for configuration merging

### Comprehensive Testing
- 39 test cases covering all functionality
- Tests for validation, environment loading, thread safety
- Integration tests with real filesystem operations
- All tests passing with 100% coverage of requirements

## Commit
- Commit: 351cdb9 - "Issue #5: Implement comprehensive configuration management system"
- Added to __init__.py public API exports
- Ready for integration with other components
