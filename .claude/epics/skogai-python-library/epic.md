# Epic: skogai-python-library

## Overview

Build a minimal, focused Python library that provides a standardized executable runner for SkogAI tools, eliminating duplicate implementations across AI agent projects. The library will be distributed via UV and follow a "batteries included but minimal" approach, focusing on the most commonly repeated operations.

## Architecture Decisions

**Core Design Principles:**
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Use Python standard library where possible to avoid bloating agent environments
- **Simple Interface**: Single import pattern `from skogai import run_executable` for immediate value
- **Fail-Fast Design**: Clear error messages and early validation to reduce debugging time
- **UV-First**: Optimized for UV package manager with proper pyproject.toml configuration

**Technology Choices:**
- **Pure Python 3.8+**: No compiled dependencies to ensure broad compatibility
- **Standard Library Focused**: subprocess, logging, pathlib, typing for core functionality
- **UV Packaging**: Modern Python packaging with pyproject.toml and UV lock files
- **Pytest**: Testing framework aligned with modern Python practices

## Technical Approach

### Core Library Structure
```
skogai/
├── __init__.py          # Main public API
├── executable.py        # Executable runner implementation
├── exceptions.py        # Custom exception hierarchy
├── config.py           # Configuration management
└── utils.py            # Common utilities
```

### Backend Services
**Not Applicable**: This is a library, not a service-oriented application.

### Infrastructure
- **UV Distribution**: Published as a standard Python package via UV
- **No Runtime Infrastructure**: Library runs within consuming applications
- **Testing Infrastructure**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD with UV integration

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP-First Approach**: Start with executable runner only, add utilities based on actual usage patterns in agent projects.

**Development Phases:**
1. **Foundation**: Core executable runner with error handling
2. **Packaging**: UV setup, documentation, basic tests
3. **Integration**: Real-world testing with existing agent projects

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **Adoption Risk**: Start with most commonly used operation (executable running)
- **API Stability**: Comprehensive type hints and clear versioning from v0.1.0
- **Performance Risk**: Benchmark against direct subprocess calls

**Testing Approach:**
- Unit tests for all public APIs
- Integration tests with mock SkogAI executables
- Performance benchmarks for import time and execution overhead

## Task Breakdown

Tasks have been decomposed into 8 focused, achievable components:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- **001: Core Library Implementation** (3-4 days)
  - Implement executable runner with error handling and logging
  - Create main skogai module structure with clean public API
  - Standard library focused implementation with type hints

- **002: UV Package Setup and Configuration** (2-3 days)
  - Configure pyproject.toml with UV optimization
  - Set up modern Python packaging and metadata
  - Prepare for UV distribution with lock files

- **003: Configuration Management and Utils** (2-3 days)
  - Implement configuration system with environment variable support
  - Create common utilities for path resolution and validation
  - Add executable discovery and caching functionality

### Phase 2: Quality and Documentation (Week 2)
- **004: Comprehensive Testing Suite** (4-5 days)
  - Unit tests for all public APIs with 95%+ coverage
  - Integration tests with mock SkogAI executables
  - Performance benchmarks for import time and execution overhead

- **005: API Documentation and Type Safety** (2-3 days)
  - Complete type annotations with mypy strict mode compatibility
  - Comprehensive docstrings with usage examples
  - API reference documentation with practical examples

- **006: Error Handling and Recovery** (3-4 days)
  - Comprehensive exception hierarchy with specific error types
  - User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
  - Error recovery patterns and logging integration

### Phase 3: Integration and Deployment (Week 3)
- **007: CI/CD Pipeline and Quality Gates** (2-3 days)
  - GitHub Actions for automated testing and publishing
  - Multi-version Python testing across platforms
  - Code quality checks and security scanning

- **008: Integration Testing and Validation** (4-5 days)
  - Real-world validation with actual SkogAI tools
  - Agent project integration testing
  - Performance validation and production readiness assessment

**Total Estimated Effort**: 22-30 development days across 3 weeks

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- **UV Package Manager**: Required for development, building, and distribution
- **Python 3.8+**: Minimum version for type hints and modern features
- **SkogAI Executables**: Need access to actual tools for integration testing

**Internal Dependencies:**
- **Agent Development Teams**: Feedback on API design and usage patterns
- **SkogAI Core Team**: Coordination on executable interfaces and standards

**Blocking Dependencies:**
- None - can start immediately with core implementation

## Success Criteria (Technical)

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Import time: < 50ms (half of PRD requirement for aggressive optimization)
- Executable launch overhead: < 10ms additional compared to direct subprocess
- Memory footprint: < 5MB for library initialization

**Quality Gates:**
- 95%+ test coverage for all public APIs
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities via safety/bandit scans
- Type checking passes with mypy strict mode
- All examples in documentation must be executable

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Successfully runs at least 3 different SkogAI executables
- Handles common error scenarios gracefully (missing executable, permission issues)
- Provides clear, actionable error messages for failure cases
- Can be imported and used in under 10 lines of code

## Estimated Effort

**Overall Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for MVP

**Development Breakdown:**
- **Week 1**: Core implementation, basic tests, UV packaging
- **Week 2**: Documentation, error handling, integration testing  
- **Week 3**: Real-world validation, refinements, publication

**Resource Requirements:**
- **1 Developer**: Full-time focus for initial implementation
- **Agent Teams**: 2-3 hours feedback sessions for API validation
- **DevOps Support**: 4 hours for CI/CD pipeline setup

**Critical Path Items:**
1. Core executable runner implementation
2. UV packaging configuration 
3. Integration testing with real agent projects
4. API finalization based on feedback
