# Execution Status

## Active Agents
- Agent-1: Issue #3 Core Implementation - ✅ COMPLETE (Analysis shows full implementation exists)
- Agent-2: Issue #4 Stream A (Core Configuration) - ✅ Design Complete, needs file modification tools
- Agent-3: Issue #4 Stream B (Package Metadata) - ✅ Analysis and planning complete

## Next Phase Ready
- Issue #4 Stream C: Package Structure Validation (waiting for Stream A completion)
- Issue #4 Stream D: Development Environment Testing (waiting for Stream A + C)
- Issue #8: Error Handling and Recovery (can start since Issue #3 complete)

## Blocked Issues (Dependency Analysis)
- Issue #6: Comprehensive Testing Suite (depends on #3 ✅, #4, #5 ✅)
- Issue #7: API Documentation and Type Safety (depends on #3 ✅, #4, #5 ✅)
- Issue #9: CI/CD Pipeline (depends on #3 ✅, #4, #6, #7, #8)
- Issue #10: Integration Testing (depends on all previous)

## Key Findings
- **Issue #3**: Already fully implemented in `src/skoglib/` with complete functionality
- **Stream A (Issue #4)**: Configuration design complete but needs file modification tools
- **Stream B (Issue #4)**: Documentation strategy planned, ready for implementation
- **Package naming**: Task specifies `skogai` but implementation uses `src/skoglib`

## Completed
- Issue #5: Configuration Management and Utils (previously completed)
- Issue #3: Core Library Implementation (existing implementation verified)
