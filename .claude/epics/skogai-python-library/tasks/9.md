# Task: CI/CD Pipeline and Quality Gates

## Objective  
Establish a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that ensures code quality, runs comprehensive tests, and automates package building and publishing while maintaining high quality standards.

## Scope
- GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD automation
- Multi-version Python testing across platforms
- Code quality checks (mypy, black, isort, security scans)
- Automated testing with coverage reporting
- Package building and publishing automation
- Quality gates that prevent low-quality code from being merged

## Technical Requirements

### CI/CD Workflow Structure
```
.github/
├── workflows/
│   ├── ci.yml              # Main CI pipeline
│   ├── release.yml         # Release and publishing
│   └── security.yml        # Security scanning
└── dependabot.yml          # Dependency updates
```

### Main CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
        python-version: ['3.8', '3.9', '3.10', '3.11', '3.12']
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Install uv
      uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v1
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      run: uv python install ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: uv sync
    - name: Run tests with coverage
      run: uv run pytest --cov=skogai --cov-report=xml
    - name: Upload coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

### Code Quality Checks
- **Black**: Code formatting enforcement
- **isort**: Import sorting validation  
- **mypy**: Static type checking in strict mode
- **bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **safety**: Dependency vulnerability checks

### Quality Gates Pipeline
```yaml
quality:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - name: Install uv
    uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v1
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: uv sync
  - name: Format check
    run: uv run black --check skogai tests
  - name: Import sorting check  
    run: uv run isort --check-only skogai tests
  - name: Type checking
    run: uv run mypy skogai
  - name: Security scan
    run: uv run bandit -r skogai
  - name: Dependency security check
    run: uv run safety check
```

### Performance Benchmarks
```yaml
performance:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - name: Install uv
    uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v1
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: uv sync
  - name: Run performance tests
    run: uv run pytest tests/performance/ --benchmark-json=benchmark.json
  - name: Validate performance requirements
    run: |
      # Validate import time < 50ms
      # Validate execution overhead < 10ms  
      # Validate memory usage < 5MB
```

### Release Pipeline (`release.yml`)
```yaml
name: Release

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  build-and-publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Install uv
      uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v1
    - name: Build package
      run: uv build
    - name: Publish to PyPI
      env:
        UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
      run: uv publish
```

### Security Scanning Pipeline
- **Scheduled scans**: Weekly dependency vulnerability checks
- **PR security checks**: Security validation on every pull request
- **SAST analysis**: Static application security testing
- **Supply chain security**: Verify package integrity

### Quality Gate Requirements
All checks must pass before merging:
- [ ] All tests pass on all supported Python versions and platforms
- [ ] Code coverage remains above 95%
- [ ] Type checking passes in strict mode
- [ ] Code formatting matches project standards
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities detected
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Import time under 50ms
- [ ] Execution overhead under 10ms

### Branch Protection Rules
```yaml
# Configure in GitHub repository settings
required_status_checks:
  strict: true
  checks:
    - "test (ubuntu-latest, 3.8)"
    - "test (ubuntu-latest, 3.12)" 
    - "quality"
    - "performance"
    - "security"
enforce_admins: true
required_pull_request_reviews:
  required_approving_review_count: 1
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CI pipeline runs on all supported Python versions (3.8-3.12)
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] All quality checks integrated and enforcing standards
- [ ] Code coverage reporting with 95%+ requirement
- [ ] Security scanning with zero critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance benchmarks validate requirements
- [ ] Automated package building and publishing
- [ ] Branch protection prevents low-quality merges
- [ ] Clear failure messages for debugging issues
- [ ] Fast pipeline execution (under 10 minutes for full CI)

## Pipeline Performance Targets
- **Full CI run**: Under 10 minutes
- **Quality checks**: Under 3 minutes
- **Test execution**: Under 5 minutes per matrix job
- **Security scans**: Under 2 minutes

## Dependencies
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- PyPI account and publishing token
- All previous tasks (001-006) completed
- UV-compatible project structure

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days for pipeline setup, testing, and validation
