# Task: UV Package Setup and Configuration

## Objective

Set up modern Python packaging using UV with proper pyproject.toml configuration, metadata, and distribution readiness.

## Scope

- Create comprehensive pyproject.toml with UV optimization
- Configure package metadata, dependencies, and build system
- Set up UV lock files for reproducible development
- Prepare package for distribution via UV

## Technical Requirements

### Configuration Files to Create

1. **`pyproject.toml`**
   - Build system configuration for UV
   - Package metadata (name, version, description, authors)
   - Dependencies specification (minimal, Python 3.8+ only)
   - Development dependencies (pytest, mypy, black, isort)
   - Entry points and console scripts if needed

2. **`uv.lock`**
   - Reproducible dependency locking
   - Development and production environment separation

3. **Package Structure**
   - Proper directory layout for UV distribution
   - `src/` layout vs. flat layout decision
   - Manifest files for package inclusion

### UV-Specific Optimizations

- Fast dependency resolution configuration
- Minimal dependency tree to reduce installation time
- Compatible version ranges for broad adoption
- Proper wheel building configuration

### Metadata Requirements

- Clear package description and keywords
- License specification (MIT or Apache 2.0)
- Repository URLs and issue tracker
- Python version classifiers
- Development status classifiers

### Development Environment Setup

```toml
[project]
name = "skogai"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Minimal Python library for SkogAI tool execution"
requires-python = ">=3.8"

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [
    "pytest>=7.0.0",
    "mypy>=1.0.0",
    "black>=23.0.0",
    "isort>=5.12.0",
]
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `uv build` successfully creates wheel and source distributions
- [ ] `uv install` works from local and remote sources
- [ ] All package metadata properly configured and valid
- [ ] Development dependencies installed via `uv sync`
- [ ] Package structure follows UV best practices
- [ ] Version management strategy defined
- [ ] License and copyright information included
- [ ] README.md basic structure (without extensive documentation)

## Dependencies

- UV package manager installed and functional
- Core library implementation (Task 001)

## Estimated Effort

2-3 days including testing and validation
